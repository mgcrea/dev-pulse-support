## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is DevPulse?

DevPulse is a macOS app that helps developers track releases for their favorite development tools and software packages. It supports Helm Charts, GitHub Releases, and GitLab Releases, with all data automatically synced across your devices via iCloud.

### How do I add a repository?

1. Click the **+** button in the toolbar
2. Select your provider (Helm Chart, GitHub, or GitLab)
3. Enter the repository information:
   - **Helm:** Enter the repository URL and select a chart from the dropdown
   - **GitHub:** Paste a GitHub URL or enter `owner/repo` format
   - **GitLab:** Paste a GitLab URL or enter `group/project` format
4. Optionally customize the name, add tags, or configure tracking options
5. Click **Add**

DevPulse automatically fetches the release history and displays it in the detail pane.

### What providers are supported?

DevPulse currently supports three provider types:

| Provider | Identifier Format | Example | Features |
|----------|------------------|---------|----------|
| **Helm Charts** | `reponame/chartname` | `https://helm.goharbor.io` → `harbor` | Auto-discover available charts from repository |
| **GitHub Releases** | `owner/repo` | `microsoft/vscode` or `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode` | Track releases or tags, regex filtering, pagination |
| **GitLab Releases** | `group/project` | `gitlab-org/gitlab` or `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab` | Support for nested groups, pagination |

### Does DevPulse sync across my devices?

Yes! DevPulse uses **iCloud CloudKit** to automatically sync your repositories across all your Macs signed in with the same Apple ID. Add a repository on one device, and it appears on all your other devices within seconds.

### How often are releases refreshed?

DevPulse caches responses for **5 minutes** to minimize API calls and respect rate limits. You can manually refresh:

- **Individual repository:** Click the refresh button in the detail view or right-click → Refresh
- **All repositories:** Click the "Refresh All" button in the toolbar

### What are the rate limits?

DevPulse respects provider rate limits:

- **GitHub (unauthenticated):** 60 requests per hour per IP address
- **GitLab:** Varies by instance (GitLab.com typically allows 2000/hour)
- **Helm:** No rate limits (depends on repository hosting)

When you hit a rate limit, DevPulse shows a user-friendly error message with the reset time. Responses are cached for 5 minutes to minimize API usage.

### Can I filter GitHub releases with regex?

Yes! When adding or editing a GitHub repository, you can enable **regex filtering** to include only releases matching a pattern:

1. Click **Edit** on a GitHub repository
2. Scroll to **Release Filter (Regex)**
3. Enter a case-insensitive regex pattern (e.g., `^v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` for semantic versions)
4. Save your changes

Only releases matching the pattern will be shown.

### What's the difference between "Releases" and "All Tags" for GitHub?

- **Releases:** Only shows official GitHub releases created via the Releases UI
- **All Tags:** Shows all git tags, including those without release notes

Use "Releases" for most projects. Use "All Tags" if the project doesn't create formal releases but tags versions.

### How do I organize my repositories?

Use **tags** to organize repositories by project, team, or technology:

1. Click **Edit** on a repository
2. Add tags in the **Tags** field (e.g., `frontend`, `production`, `devops`)
3. Save your changes
4. Use the **Filter** button (tag icon) in the toolbar to filter by tag

### Can I export my repositories?

Yes! Press **⌘⇧E** or use **File → Export Repositories...** to export your repository list. This is useful for backups or sharing your configuration.

### What macOS version is required?

DevPulse requires **macOS 26.0 or later** (currently in beta). The final release will target the appropriate stable macOS version.

### Does DevPulse require internet access?

Yes, DevPulse needs internet access to:

- Fetch release information from Helm repositories, GitHub, and GitLab
- Sync your data via iCloud CloudKit

DevPulse requires the **Outgoing Connections (Client)** capability in the App Sandbox.

### Why aren't releases showing up?

Common reasons:

1. **Rate limit exceeded:** Wait for the limit to reset (shown in error message)
2. **Invalid identifier:** Verify the format matches the provider requirements
3. **Private repository:** GitHub/GitLab authentication not yet implemented (coming soon)
4. **Date parsing failure:** Check Console.app for parsing warnings and report an issue

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug? Please help us improve DevPulse by reporting it!

### Before Reporting

1. **Update to the latest version** - Your issue might already be fixed
2. **Search existing issues** - Someone might have already reported it

## Supported Providers

### Helm Charts

**Identifier Format:** `reponame/chartname` (e.g., `harbor`)

**How to add:**
1. Enter the full Helm repository URL (e.g., `https://helm.goharbor.io`)
2. Select a chart from the auto-populated dropdown
3. DevPulse fetches all releases from the repository's `index.yaml`

**Features:**
- Auto-discovery of available charts
- 5-minute response caching
- Handles various timestamp formats (nanoseconds, microseconds, timezones)

**Example repositories:**
- Harbor: `https://helm.goharbor.io` → `harbor`
- Bitnami: `https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami` → various charts

### GitHub Releases

**Identifier Format:** `owner/repo` (e.g., `microsoft/vscode`)

**How to add:**
1. Paste a GitHub URL or enter `owner/repo` format
2. DevPulse automatically extracts the identifier
3. Choose between tracking "Releases" or "All Tags"
4. Optionally add a regex filter

**Features:**
- Smart URL extraction from `github.com/owner/repo`, `.git` URLs
- Track releases OR all git tags
- Case-insensitive regex filtering
- Pagination (loads more releases on demand)
- Rate limiting with friendly error messages (60/hour unauthenticated)
- 5-minute response caching
- Download links for release assets

**Example repositories:**
- `microsoft/vscode` - Visual Studio Code
- `facebook/react` - React library
- `kubernetes/kubernetes` - Kubernetes

### GitLab Releases

**Identifier Format:** `group/project` or `group/subgroup/project` (e.g., `gitlab-org/gitlab`)

**How to add:**
1. Paste a GitLab URL or enter `group/project` format
2. DevPulse automatically extracts and URL-encodes the identifier
3. Supports nested groups

**Features:**
- Smart URL extraction from `gitlab.com/group/project`
- Support for nested group hierarchies
- URL-encoding for special characters
- Pagination (loads more releases on demand)
- Rate limiting with friendly error messages
- 5-minute response caching
- Download links for release assets

**Example repositories:**
- `gitlab-org/gitlab` - GitLab itself
- `inkscape/inkscape` - Inkscape vector editor
- `fdroid/fdroidclient` - F-Droid client

## Tips & Best Practices

### Paste URLs Directly

Instead of manually typing identifiers, paste full URLs:
- **GitHub:** `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode` → auto-extracts `microsoft/vscode`
- **GitLab:** `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab` → auto-extracts `gitlab-org/gitlab`

DevPulse handles `.git` suffix removal and common URL variations.

### Use Tags for Organization

Organize repositories by:
- **Project:** `project-alpha`, `project-beta`
- **Team:** `frontend`, `backend`, `devops`
- **Technology:** `rust`, `nodejs`, `kubernetes`
- **Priority:** `production`, `staging`, `development`

This makes filtering much easier when you have many repositories.

### Right-Click for Quick Actions

Right-click any repository in the sidebar for quick access to:
- **Refresh** - Update this repository's releases
- **Delete** - Remove the repository

### Monitor Rate Limits

If you're tracking many GitHub repositories:
- Spread out manual refreshes to avoid hitting rate limits
- Use "Refresh All" sparingly (counts as one request per repository)
- Wait for the 5-minute cache to expire before refreshing again
- Consider implementing authentication when available (coming soon)

### Use Regex Filters Wisely

For GitHub repositories with many tags:
- Filter to semantic versions: `^v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`
- Filter to major versions: `^v?1\.`
- Filter to release candidates: `rc|beta|alpha`

Remember: regex is case-insensitive.

### Search Efficiently

The search box filters by:
- Repository name
- Repository identifier (`owner/repo`, `group/project`)
- Repository URL

This means you can quickly find repositories by typing any of these.
